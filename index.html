Junior Example Site
===================

Put you Markdown code here. It's recommended to put `fallback.css` in the head, as this contains some basic styles which will be applied for users who have JS disabled (the page will display Markdown code with minimal formatting).

<script src="/junior/js/jr.js"></script>

</pre></body>
</html>
