# Welcome to Jr!

A static, static content generator that moves the "generator" part to the browser.
This site is pure text files with a single Javascript included on each page that renders
the theme and assets as needed.

This fork makes some small changes to the original source to make make the bare-bones pages somewhat more standards compliant by adding a html skeleton.

Demo can be seen on this prototype download website for a conference paper: http://processmining.be/locationaware
