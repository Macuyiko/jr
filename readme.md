# Welcome to Jr!

A static, static content generator that moves the "generator" part to the browser.
This site is pure text files with a single Javascript included on each page that renders
the theme and assets as needed.

**This fork** makes some changes to the original source to make make the bare-bones pages somewhat more standards compliant by adding a html skeleton, a fallback style sheet for people with Javascript disabled, and separate out the inclusion of HTML files over AJAX (for the header and footer) to a separate library.

Demo can be seen on this website: http://processmining.be/fodina (view source or disable Javascript to inspect the effects)
